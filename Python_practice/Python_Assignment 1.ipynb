    "Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because, Python can be used in a wide variety of applications like Data Science, Machine learning, web development etc... Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language. Object-oriented means this language is based around objects (such as data) rather than functions, and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand."

    "\n",
    "Python don't have any problem even if we don't declare the type of variable. It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. Python also take cares of the memory management which is crucial in programming. So, Python is a dynamically typed language."
